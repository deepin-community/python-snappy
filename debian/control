Description: snappy compression library from Google - Python 3.x
 Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for
 maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression
 library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable
 compression. You can read package libsnappy1 for more information.
 .
